- Write a program that uses lambda expressions to sort a list of strings in alphabetical order.
- You are given a List<String> representing a list of words. Create a lambda expression to sort the list in alphabetical
  order. Next, modify your lambda expression to sort the list in reverse alphabetical order.
- Create a functional interface with a method that takes two strings as input and returns an integer. Implement this
  interface using a lambda expression to create a custom comparator that compares strings based on their length (not
  lexicographically).
- Create a functional interface with a method that takes a List<String> representing first names and returns a
  List<String> of those names formatted in uppercase. Implement it using a lambda expression.
